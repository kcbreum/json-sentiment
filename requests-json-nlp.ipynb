Similarly, Love Story is a mix of being upset at the forbidden love but at the same time has all the wording of a happy love song, especially by the end, so it makes sense for its score to be fairly close to a 0. The one I'm most suprised by is Bohemian Rhapsody. When looking at the lyrics, there aren't really very many positives to the story it tells, so I assumed it would have a lower negative score."
